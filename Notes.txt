React is declartive, effiecent and flexible js libary.

	Declarative :you decalre some thing, it render based ypur place holder and decalrations
	effiecent :  as changes are in individual virtual dom and later reflect to actual dom
	flexible :slowly react has moved from php to jsx with minor dom element changes

It is an open-source, component-based front end library . Architecture of React is Redux or Flux.

React is small units of reusable components , components can be nested and made has higer level component
 
We do not write code into dom object , first we write code in virtual DOM and then we transfer that dom to actual dom

Pre-requisite 
	NodeJS and NPM :node -v and npm -v
	React and React DOM =>npm i react react-dom --save
	Webpack=>complie all js as one unit,used for module packaging, development, and production pipeline automation. 
			webpack-dev-server=> development
			webpack =>production build
			webpack CLI => set of commands
    Babel=>compiler and transpiler
			babel-loader =>used for JSX file types
			babel-preset-react => browser update automatically changes to dom
			babel-preset-env => es6 needs it 


two ways to create react application
	1)Using the npm command => mkdir reactApp
		 =>npm init -y 
		 =>npm i react react-dom --save
		 =>npm install webpack webpack-dev-server webpack-cli --save
		 =>npm install babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-env babel-preset-react babel-webpack-plugin --save-dev
		 =>npm i --save-dev html-webpack-plugin
		 =>create index.html  App.js main.js webpack.config.js  .babelrc 
		 
    2)Using the create-react-app command=> npx create-react-app jtp-reactapp  (or)
	 npm install -g create-react-app  =>create-react-app jtp-reactapp  
	 
Features:
			JSX =>JSX stands for JavaScript XML or html.
			Components =>omponent has its own logic and controls and it can reusable
			One-way Data Binding:it follows unidirectional data flow , here components  are supposed to be  immutable and the data within them cannot be changed
			Virtual DOM :it works with one-way data binding and any change in application render VDOM and then transfer to actual DOM and  changes only that DOM node
			Simplicity :ReactJS uses JSX file which is easy to understand and reusable  
			Performance :it is fast due to  virtual DOM
